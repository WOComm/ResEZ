	<patTemplate:comment> We want to run the show_main_menu script in bottom because that's towards the end of the run. This gives other templates the opportunity to set {jomres_script disable_main_menu} if required, before it appears. It also allows other scripts, for example access control, to remove menu options or some other tasks, before the menu is displayed.
	
	When the menu is rendered then menu_location_div_id will determine where the menu should be placed (if it hasn't been disabled). jomres_alternate_menu_position is the default and it's in top.html
	
	Added benefit : Saves designers from needing to edit code to enable/disable the menu, they can do it through a simple shortcode. I've used it in 10.7 to prevent the menu from showing on the property details page.
	
	The menu is nowadays rendered in mainmenu_wrapper_alternate.html and javascript in there moves the menu to the appropriate div. </patTemplate:comment>
