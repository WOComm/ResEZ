Jomres offers 3 different template sets, Bootstrap 2, Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 5.

Directories :

Bootstrap -> Bootstrap 2

Bootstrap3 -> Bootstrap 3

Bootstrap5 -> Bootstrap 5

--

Joomla 2 & 3 uses templates from the Bootstrap 2 > Administrator directory for admin area scripts.

Wordpress any version uses  Bootstrap 2 > Administrator directory for admin area scripts.

Joomla 5 uses templates from the Bootstrap 5 > Administrator director for admin area scripts.

The Bootstrap Version setting in Administrator > Jomres > Settings > Site Configuration tells Jomres which Bootstrap set to use.

--

Each of these sets has a further two subdirectories called Frontend and Backend. 

Backend templates are template files that are used by property manager scripts.

Frontend templates are template files that are used by scripts that make up the site.

There is a little crossover, for example the list invoices page can be used by both managers and guests, but in general the two sets are distinct. The separation is purely to make it a little easier to find a template file.

If you want to edit any of these template files, there is lots of information in the manual here : https://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide-2/68-customising-jomres/customising-templates-layout

It is recommended that you follow the information on that page if you ever want to update Jomres, otherwise your changes will be over-ridden.
