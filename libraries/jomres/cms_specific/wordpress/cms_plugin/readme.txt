== Description ==

= The multi-property, multi-vendor, multi-language booking portal, be a part of something bigger =

Mature, intelligent, secure and powerful. Started in 2005 and maintained continuously for the last 17 years, Jomres is the most complete online booking engine available for WordPress.

The Core system is free (install it through the WordPress plugin manager) and extend it through <a href="https://www.jomres.net/jomres-plugin-list">200 Jomres plugins</a> which can be installed through the Jomres Plugin Manager at no extra cost once you have a license.

Jomres is a commission-free, responsive, Open Source multi-vendor, multi-language, multi-property online booking plugin for accommodation, rentals and tours used by thousands of businesses worldwide to manage their properties and reservations. You can create an unlimited number of booking websites, accessible to customers on any device, in any language.

From basic features like secure frontend property administration, comprehensive and flexible [search features](http://www.jomres.net/manual/site-managers-guide-2/402-search-widgets), [iCal import and export](http://www.jomres.net/manual/property-managers-guide-2/41-your-toolbar/bookings/328-jomres-ical), through to powerful developer tools such as its built-in [REST API](http://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide-2/90-channel-management-framework) and  [Webhooks](http://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide-2/64-webhooks) functionality, there's something here for everybody. Whether you are looking for a booking engine for a single property site, or a complete portal, Jomres is where it's at.

Jomres is created and maintained by me, Vince Wooll. I am not a designer or a marketer, I'm a software engineer who believes that there's still a place for the solo developer in today's internet. I think of Jomres as less a booking engine and more a toolkit, with a set of tools that my users can use to build their own unique online websites. Jomres follows that line of thinking with it's strong emphasis on giving you, the user, the [information and tools](http://www.jomres.net/manual/) you need to create something amazing.

== What's new? ==

= Bootstrap no longer required =

Jomres can now be run on non-Bootstrap themes. Woot!


== Demos ==

[See the Portal Demo here - a variety of bookable items, multiple owners](http://wordpress-portal.jomres.net/)

Essential License holders can download the "QuickStart" zip file that enables you to deploy a full installation of WordPress with everything already set up to exactly match the Demo. You can be up-and-running, with a fully-featured booking website that looks terrific, within minutes.


== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins > Add New

2. Search for "Jomres"

3. Click Install and activate the plugin. Note, Jomres Core is actually downloaded during activation. As Jomres is pretty big, this can take a minute or more on a slow connection. Please be patient, it's worth the wait.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Jomres free? =

Yes. Jomres follows the [Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_core) business model for Open Source projects. The Jomres Core itself is free to download and install. To help pay the bills some features of the system are delivered as plugins in the Jomres Plugin Manager, to download those you will need a license key saved in your Jomres installation's Site Configuration page.

= Is there a manual? =

Yup, the [manual](https://www.jomres.net/manual/) is available to all users. It's very well documented, and there are video tutorials if you prefer to learn that way.


= Where can I get support? =

If you've got a download and support license you can raise a [ticket](http://tickets.jomres.net).
